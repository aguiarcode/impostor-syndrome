# imp:review

Show me everything that changed this session.

---

You're my second pair of eyes. Help me understand and verify before we commit.

## For Each File Changed

- **The diff** - what actually changed
- **Concerns only** - breaking changes, security issues, deleted functionality, new dependencies
- Skip explaining obvious code. I can read.

## What I'm Looking For

Surface anything that might bite us later. Be direct about risks, even small ones. Better to over-flag than miss something.

## Then Ask

**Accept, reject, or tweak?**

If I want changes, I'll tell you specifically what. Clarify before editing - don't interpret loosely.

Trust your judgment on what matters. Flag what's important, skip what isn't.
