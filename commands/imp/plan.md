# imp:plan

The user wants to plan: **$ARGUMENTS**

---

## Your Task

Analyze the request and propose an implementation approach. Do NOT write any code.

## Steps

1. **Clarify** — If the request is ambiguous, ask specific questions first. Don't assume.

2. **Scope** — List exactly which files will be:
   - Created (new files)
   - Modified (existing files)
   - Deleted (if any)

3. **Approach** — Describe your plan in plain language:
   - What will you build/change?
   - How will the pieces connect?
   - What's the order of implementation?

4. **Risks** — Flag anything the user should know:
   - New dependencies required
   - Breaking changes to existing code
   - Security considerations
   - Unknowns or assumptions you're making

5. **Wait** — Ask for explicit approval before proceeding to `/imp:do`.

## Rules

- No code. Not even pseudocode. Plain language only.
- Be specific. "Update the API" is bad. "Add a POST /users endpoint in routes/api.js" is good.
- If the scope is large, suggest breaking it into smaller plans.
