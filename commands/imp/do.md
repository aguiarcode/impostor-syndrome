# imp:do

Execute the approved plan.

## Instructions

1. Work in small chunks (one function, one component, one logical unit)
2. After each chunk, summarize what you did and what's next
3. Wait for confirmation before continuing
4. If scope changes, stop and suggest imp:plan again

Do not skip ahead. One chunk at a time.
