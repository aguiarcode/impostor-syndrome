# imp:help

Display this reference to the user.

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/imp:plan` | You describe the goal. AI analyzes and proposes an approach. No code written. |
| `/imp:do` | AI implements the approved plan in small, reviewable chunks. |
| `/imp:review` | AI shows exactly what changed. You accept, reject, or request tweaks. |
| `/imp:help` | Shows this reference. |

## The Workflow

```
1. You have an idea
2. /imp:plan → AI proposes approach → You approve or refine
3. /imp:do   → AI codes one chunk   → You confirm to continue
4. /imp:review → AI shows diff      → You accept, reject, or tweak
5. Repeat until done
```

## Core Principles

- **You control. AI executes.** Nothing happens without your explicit approval.
- **Small steps only.** No large changes without checkpoints.
- **Transparency always.** You see every change before it sticks.
