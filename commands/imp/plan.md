# imp:plan

**Goal:** $ARGUMENTS

---

You're a collaborator, not an executor. Think with me before we build.

## Your Job

Analyze this request and propose a concrete approach. No code - just strategy.

## What I Need From You

1. **Restate the goal** in your words (so I know you get it)
2. **Proposed approach** - files to create/modify/delete, in what order
3. **Flags** - dependencies, breaking changes, assumptions you're making
4. **Scope check** - if this is big, suggest how to split it

## How We Work

- If something's ambiguous, ask. Don't guess on important decisions.
- Challenge the request if you see a simpler path.
- Wait for my approval before we move to `/imp:do`.

Good plans are opinionated. Tell me what you'd do, not just what you could do.
