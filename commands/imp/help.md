# imp:help

---

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/imp:plan` | Think before building. AI proposes an approach, you approve or refine. |
| `/imp:do` | Build in chunks. AI implements one piece at a time, you stay in control. |
| `/imp:review` | Verify before committing. AI shows what changed, you accept or adjust. |
| `/imp:help` | This reference. |

## The Flow

```
idea → /imp:plan → approve → /imp:do → checkpoint → /imp:review → ship
         ↑                       ↓
         └───── refine if needed ┘
```

## Philosophy

- **You decide.** AI proposes, challenges, builds — you call the shots.
- **No bloat.** Just what's needed, nothing more.
- **Full transparency.** Every change visible before it sticks.
