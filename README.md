# impostor-syndrome
Using AI to write code always made me feel like an impostor. This project accepts the discomfort and turns it into a minimal, explicit workflow.
These commands / meta-prompts shine brightest when you already know how to code.  
Their real power is acceleration and structure — not teaching fundamentals.  
If you're still learning syntax, debugging patterns, or system design, the value drops sharply!

Full human control is non-negotiable.

## Installation 
```bash
npx @aguiarcode/impostor-syndrome 
Options:
--global → install commands to ~/.claude/commands/imp/ (available in every project)
--local → install only to current project's ./.claude/commands/imp/
After install, open Claude Code in your project and type /imp:help to confirm.
```

## Philosophy

- Minimalism beats complexity
- The prompt should be short enough to fully understand at a glance.

- Explicit control over implicit automation
- Nothing should happen without your approval or awareness.

- Discomfort is a signal, not a flaw
- Impostor syndrome isn’t ignored here—it’s the reason the system exists.
