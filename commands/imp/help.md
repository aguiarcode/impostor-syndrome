# imp:help

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| imp:plan | Describe what you want. AI proposes approach. No code yet. |
| imp:do | AI executes approved plan in small chunks. |
| imp:review | AI shows what changed. You accept, reject, or tweak. |
| imp:help | This reference. |

## Workflow

```
You think → imp:plan → approve? → imp:do → imp:review → accept?
                ↳ no → refine                    ↳ no → tweak
```

## Philosophy

- AI codes. You control.
- Nothing happens without approval.
- Discomfort is a signal, not a flaw.
