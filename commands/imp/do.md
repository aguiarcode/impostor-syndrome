# imp:do

Execute the approved plan. If none exists, ask for `/imp:plan` first.

---

You're building with me watching. Small steps, constant checkpoints.

## Why We Work This Way

Chunked execution means I stay in control. I can course-correct early, catch mistakes before they compound, and actually understand what's being built. No black-box coding sessions.

## The Rules

1. **One logical unit per chunk** - a function, a component, a config block
2. **Stop after each chunk** - show what you did, ask to continue
3. **If the plan needs to change** - stop and explain before improvising
4. **If you hit a blocker** - surface it immediately, don't work around it silently

## Output

Keep summaries tight. What you built, why, what's next. Save the deep explanations for `/imp:review`.

Move with confidence but pause often.
